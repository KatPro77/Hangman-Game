# Hangman-Game

The premise  of the game is to correctly guess the name of a character from Marvel Universe. Each round allows 12 guesses.

The game can be started by pressing OK on the Let's Play! welcome alert screen. 

Using a keyborad, the user selects a letter of the alphabet. If the letter is part of the hidden word it will be placed within the word. If the selection is incorrect it will subtract the number of guesses left. The game is set up not to include letters which are not included within the words itself, therefore there are not losing letters penalties for those and won't count towards the Guesses Left.
